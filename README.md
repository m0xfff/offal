Offal is a tool for isolating hard to reproduce bugs. I have been inspired by Adam Tornhill's [Your Code as a Crime Scene](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime2/your-code-as-a-crime-scene-second-edition/).

## Installing Offal

To install Offal, you can use the following command:

```bash
pipx install offal
